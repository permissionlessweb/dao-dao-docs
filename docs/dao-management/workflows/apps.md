# Making Use of DAO Apps

DAO Apps is a tab in all DAOs for members to interact with web-applications and propose for actions to broadcasted as a DAO.

## Why use DAO Apps?
- **Familiar UX:** Navigating through apps as a DAO provides a very close experience to interacting with apps as a single wallet, from your browser.
- **Pre Propose Approver:** [Explained in detail here](../../dao-governance/proposals/proposal-approver#2-approving-proposals), a DAO serving as a pre-proposal approver can use DAO apps for the approver workflow.


## Workflow 

### 1. Navigate To Your DAOs Apps Tab

### 2. Choose An App To Use
:::warning
Apps must explicitly support DAO DAO app integration. Unless you are sure that an app is supported, it likely will not work. Custom app entry is primarily to help developers test new app integrations. Contact the app's developers if you want them to add DAO DAO support.

### 3. Choose Your Actions
